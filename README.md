# Telecom Provide API

This application is implemented using Spring boot, Java 8, Maven, Junit and Mockito.


# Brief about application execution:
I implemented this application without database to avoid the DB dependencies and complexity.

I have mocked the service and written few test cases to test the APIs.

The project can be simply run with maven clean install command which will also run test cases.
